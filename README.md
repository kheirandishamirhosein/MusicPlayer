# MusicPlayer
---------------
This is a personal music player that I made myself inspired by Google Market music players. I use different sources to make it.
I used the following topics to make it :
---------------
1. request Permission
-> To access mobile phone audio files (permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
2. MediaStore
3. data class model
4. recyclerview
5. intents
5. use seekbar and play music
6. use dependencies library
-> glide
-> for notification and service
7. mediaPlayer
8. activity and fragment
9. material design
10. class Application
11. service for notification
13. oop
